# [Project 1: Integral Data Project - Olist: Project Overview](https://github.com/mnperezluma/Olist)
- Initialized the process of Exploraty Data Analysis to understand properly the dataset being used.
- Set up the Extract, Transform and Load process using Python and PostgreSQL as database management system.
- Created a server on Microsoft Azure to be able to interact with the Data Warehouse in a common environment.  
- Developed a Machine Learning Project based on time series forecasting. 
- Built interactive dashboards on PowerBi to perform better analysis related to our data.

# [Project 2: Finance Project - S&P 500: Project Overview](https://github.com/mnperezluma/FinanceProject)
- Used BeatifulSoup library to extract the necessary data from Wikipedia. 
- Worked with Pandas and YahooFinance API, to perform proper analysis related to daily returns and specific industries.
- Implemented data visualisations with MatPlotlib, to examine the direct relationship between VIX and S&P500 from 2017 to 2021. 
- Developed a matrix correlation table using SeaBorn, to evaluate assets performance from a recommended investment portfolio.
